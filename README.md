## Overview

### Description

Park Alert - The Future of Parking  
A mobile platform that helps people alert each other of parking spots in their radius.

- Delivered and presented multiple UML diagrams to demonstrate the scope and design of my system once a week across a 16-week span.
- This included robust use and test cases. I also did components, deployment, ERD, and several other diagrams.
- Utilized the Flutter framework and used the Dart language to build a prototype design.
